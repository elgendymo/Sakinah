# Requirements Document - Frontend-Backend Alignment

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for aligning the Sakinah application's frontend pages with the new backend endpoints, completing unfinished backend features, and establishing comprehensive end-to-end testing. The application is a privacy-focused Islamic spiritual development platform using a modular monolith architecture with Next.js frontend and Express.js backend. The alignment process involves migrating from legacy endpoints to versioned API routes, implementing missing backend functionality, and ensuring complete test coverage for all user workflows.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: API Endpoint Migration

**User Story:**  As a developer, I want the frontend to use versioned API endpoints, so that we can standardize on the new v1 and remove legacy versions.

#### Acceptance Criteria
	1.	WHEN a frontend page makes an API request THEN the application SHALL use the versioned endpoint (v1) instead of legacy endpoints
	2.	IF the API version header is not specified THEN the system SHALL default to the latest stable version (v1)
	3.	WHERE the habits page toggles a habit completion THEN the system SHALL use separate /v1/habits/:id/complete and /v1/habits/:id/incomplete endpoints instead of the legacy toggle endpoint
	4.	WHEN migrating code references THEN the system SHALL replace all v2 usages with v1 and adapt to the new response format conventions
	5.	IF a v1 endpoint is unavailable THEN the system SHALL raise an error (no backward compatibility supported)
	6.	AFTER the migration is complete THEN the system SHALL remove all support for previous API versions and rely solely on v1 endpoints

### Requirement 2: Frontend Page Updates

**User Story:** As a user, I want all application features to work seamlessly with the new backend infrastructure, so that I experience consistent and reliable functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard page loads THEN the system SHALL fetch active plans from `/v2/plans/active` with proper authentication headers
2. WHERE the Habits page displays habit data THEN the system SHALL retrieve habits from `/v2/habits` with query parameters for stats and history inclusion
3. WHEN a user completes a habit on the Habits page THEN the system SHALL send a POST request to `/v2/habits/:id/complete` with optimistic UI updates
4. IF the Journal page searches entries THEN the system SHALL use the `/v2/journal` endpoint with proper search query parameters
5. WHEN the Tazkiyah page suggests a plan THEN the system SHALL use the `/v2/ai/suggest-plan` endpoint with the new request/response format
6. WHERE the Check-in page submits daily muhasabah THEN the system SHALL use `/v2/checkins` with the updated schema
7. WHILE the Content page loads spiritual content THEN the system SHALL fetch from `/v2/content` with enhanced filtering capabilities

### Requirement 3: Missing Backend Implementation

**User Story:** As a product owner, I want all frontend features to have corresponding backend implementations, so that the application functions completely without mock data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Dashboard displays prayer times THEN the backend SHALL provide a `/v2/prayer-times` endpoint that calculates times based on user location
2. IF the Dashboard shows today's intention THEN the backend SHALL implement `/v2/intentions` endpoints for CRUD operations
3. WHERE the Dashboard tracks dhikr count THEN the backend SHALL provide `/v2/dhikr` endpoints for incrementing and retrieving counts
4. WHEN the Profile page manages user preferences THEN the backend SHALL implement `/v2/users/preferences` for storing language, location, and calculation methods
5. IF the Onboarding flow collects user information THEN the backend SHALL provide `/v2/onboarding` endpoints for progressive data collection
6. WHILE offline mode is enabled THEN the backend SHALL support `/v2/sync` endpoints for data synchronization when connection is restored
7. WHERE habit streaks are calculated THEN the backend SHALL implement streak calculation logic in the `/v2/habits/:id/analytics` endpoint

### Requirement 4: Error Handling and Resilience

**User Story:** As a user, I want the application to handle errors gracefully and provide helpful feedback, so that I can understand and resolve issues quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. IF a 401 Unauthorized response is received THEN the system SHALL redirect to the login page with the return URL preserved
3. WHERE a 429 Too Many Requests response occurs THEN the system SHALL implement exponential backoff with a maximum of 3 retry attempts
4. WHEN a 500 Internal Server Error occurs THEN the system SHALL log the error details and display a generic error message to the user
5. IF the backend returns validation errors (400) THEN the system SHALL display field-specific error messages in the relevant form inputs
6. WHILE operating in offline mode THEN the system SHALL queue failed requests and retry when connectivity is restored
7. WHERE deprecated endpoints return warnings THEN the system SHALL log migration notices to assist developers

### Requirement 5: Data Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want a smooth data migration process, so that users experience no data loss during the transition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating user data THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity by validating all migrated records
2. IF data format differences exist between versions THEN the system SHALL apply transformation functions to ensure compatibility
3. WHERE legacy data contains deprecated fields THEN the system SHALL map them to new schema fields or archive them appropriately
4. WHILE migration is in progress THEN the system SHALL operate in dual-write mode to maintain consistency
5. WHEN migration completes THEN the system SHALL verify data completeness through automated reconciliation checks
6. IF migration fails THEN the system SHALL rollback to the previous state without data loss

### Requirement 6: End-to-End Testing Coverage

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want comprehensive E2E tests covering all user workflows, so that we can ensure system reliability across updates.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running E2E tests THEN the system SHALL test the complete authentication flow including login, session management, and logout
2. WHERE the Tazkiyah workflow is tested THEN the tests SHALL cover plan suggestion, creation, and activation with both takhliyah and tahliyah modes
3. IF testing habit management THEN the tests SHALL verify creation, completion, streak tracking, and analytics retrieval
4. WHEN testing the journal feature THEN the tests SHALL validate entry creation, search, tagging, and deletion workflows
5. WHERE check-in functionality is tested THEN the tests SHALL confirm daily submission, mood tracking, and reflection storage
