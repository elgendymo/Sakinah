# Journal Improvements Requirements Document

## Introduction

The journal feature is a core component of the Sakinah application that enables users to maintain a private spiritual journal for self-reflection and spiritual growth. This requirements document outlines both immediate fixes needed to restore basic functionality and enhancement features to create a comprehensive journaling system.
